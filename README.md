# SpaceInvaders

An old school project but one of my favorites, Space Invaders was a project where we were let off the leash to build it however we wanted without the guidance from our professors.
The project has some outdated components and contains a couple bugs, however, is a project I enjoyed and eventually wish to remake with my improved skills.
